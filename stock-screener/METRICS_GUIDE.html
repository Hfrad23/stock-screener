<h1>Metrics Reference Guide — S&P 500 Value Screener</h1>
<p>A plain-English explanation of every metric used in the screener,<br>what it measures, and what to look for when evaluating a stock.</p>
<hr>
<h2>VALUATION METRICS</h2>
<em>(Lower is generally better — you're paying less for what the company produces)</em>
<hr>
<h3>1. P/E — Price-to-Earnings Ratio</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Current share price divided by earnings per share (EPS).
It tells you how many dollars you're paying for every $1 of profit.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Share Price ÷ Earnings Per Share</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>< 10</td><td>Very cheap — possible deep value or a struggling business</td></tr>
<tr><td>10–15</td><td>Cheap to fair — classic value territory</td></tr>
<tr><td>15–20</td><td>Fair — roughly in line with the long-run S&P 500 average</td></tr>
<tr><td>20–30</td><td>Moderately expensive — growth is being priced in</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 30</td><td>Expensive — requires strong growth to justify</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> Under 15, ideally under 12.
<strong>Sector caveat:</strong> Banks and insurers often trade at 8–12×; tech at 20–35× is normal.
<hr>
<h3>2. P/FCF — Price-to-Free Cash Flow</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Share price divided by free cash flow per share.
Free cash flow (FCF) = operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.
This is often considered MORE reliable than P/E because earnings can be
manipulated with accounting, but cash in the bank is real.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Market Cap ÷ Free Cash Flow</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>< 10</td><td>Very cheap — generating a lot of cash relative to price</td></tr>
<tr><td>10–15</td><td>Attractive — solid cash generation</td></tr>
<tr><td>15–20</td><td>Fair</td></tr>
<tr><td>20–30</td><td>Pricey — growth expectations baked in</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 30</td><td>Expensive — need high FCF growth to justify</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> Under 15.
<strong>Why it matters more than P/E:</strong> Companies can show accounting profits
while burning cash. P/FCF cuts through that.
<hr>
<h3>3. EV/EBITDA — Enterprise Value to EBITDA</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> The total cost to acquire the entire business (equity + debt - cash)
divided by operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation & amortization.
This is the metric used most often in M&A because it's capital-structure neutral
— it doesn't matter how the company is financed.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>(Market Cap + Debt - Cash) ÷ EBITDA</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>< 6</td><td>Very cheap — common in commodities, financials</td></tr>
<tr><td>6–10</td><td>Attractive — value territory for most sectors</td></tr>
<tr><td>10–14</td><td>Fair — average for the S&P 500</td></tr>
<tr><td>14–20</td><td>Pricey</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 20</td><td>Expensive — tech/growth premium</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> Under 10.
<strong>Why it's useful:</strong> Works across sectors because it ignores debt and taxes.
<hr>
<h3>4. P/B — Price-to-Book Ratio</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Share price divided by book value per share.
Book value = total assets minus total liabilities — essentially what the
company would be worth if it liquidated everything today.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Share Price ÷ (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) per share</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>< 1.0</td><td>Trading below liquidation value — rare, often a red flag OR deep value</td></tr>
<tr><td>1–2</td><td>Cheap — paying close to asset value</td></tr>
<tr><td>2–3</td><td>Fair</td></tr>
<tr><td>3–5</td><td>Pricey — intangibles or brand value not on balance sheet</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 5</td><td>Expensive for asset-heavy companies; normal for capital-light tech</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> Under 2.5 (sector-adjusted — banks at 1×, tech at 5× is fine).
<strong>Best for:</strong> Banks, insurers, industrials, real estate. Less useful for software.
<hr>
<h3>5. PEG — Price/Earnings-to-Growth Ratio</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> P/E divided by expected earnings growth rate.
It adjusts the P/E for growth — a company growing at 20% deserves a
higher P/E than one growing at 2%. PEG makes that comparison fair.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>P/E Ratio ÷ Expected Annual Earnings Growth Rate (%)</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>< 0.5</td><td>Potentially very undervalued relative to growth</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.5–1.0</td><td>Attractive — growth not fully priced in</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.0</td><td>Fair value — paying exactly for the growth you get</td></tr>
<tr><td>1–1.5</td><td>Slightly elevated</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 1.5</td><td>Overpaying for growth</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> Under 1.0, ideally under 0.75.
<strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> PEG < 1 = good deal. Peter Lynch popularised this metric.
<hr>
<h2>QUALITY METRICS</h2>
<em>(Higher is generally better — measuring how well the business performs)</em>
<hr>
<h3>6. ROE — Return on Equity</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Net income divided by shareholders' equity.
Measures how efficiently a company uses shareholder money to generate profit.
A high ROE means management is good at compounding your investment.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>< 5%</td><td>Weak — barely covering cost of equity</td></tr>
<tr><td>5–10%</td><td>Below average</td></tr>
<tr><td>10–15%</td><td>Solid — decent business</td></tr>
<tr><td>15–20%</td><td>Good — competitive advantage likely</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 20%</td><td>Excellent — strong moat (think Apple, Visa, MSFT)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> 15%+ consistently over multiple years.
<strong>Caveat:</strong> Very high ROE (>50%) can be inflated by heavy debt — check D/E too.
<hr>
<h3>7. ROA — Return on Assets</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Net income divided by total assets.
Unlike ROE, this isn't affected by how much debt a company carries.
It shows how efficiently assets are deployed regardless of financing.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Net Income ÷ Total Assets</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>< 2%</td><td>Poor — asset-intensive business with thin margins</td></tr>
<tr><td>2–5%</td><td>Below average</td></tr>
<tr><td>5–10%</td><td>Good</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 10%</td><td>Excellent — capital-light business with strong returns</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> 5%+.
<strong>Best for:</strong> Comparing companies within the same sector.
<hr>
<h3>8. Operating Margin</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Operating income as a percentage of revenue.
Measures how much profit the company keeps from each dollar of sales
after paying operating costs — but before interest and taxes.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Operating Income ÷ Revenue</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>< 5%</td><td>Thin margins — vulnerable to cost shocks</td></tr>
<tr><td>5–10%</td><td>Low but acceptable in some industries (retail, airlines)</td></tr>
<tr><td>10–20%</td><td>Healthy</td></tr>
<tr><td>20–30%</td><td>Strong — pricing power or cost efficiency</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 30%</td><td>Exceptional — classic moat indicator (software, pharma)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> 15%+, and stable or expanding over time.
<strong>Sector norms:</strong> Grocery retail: 2–4%. Software: 20–40%. Pharma: 15–30%.
<hr>
<h3>9. Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Total debt divided by total shareholders' equity.
Measures financial leverage — how much of the business is funded by
borrowed money vs. owner money. High debt = higher risk, especially in
rising interest rate environments.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>Total Debt ÷ Total Shareholders' Equity</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>< 0.3</td><td>Very conservative — fortress balance sheet</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.3–0.75</td><td>Healthy leverage</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.75–1.5</td><td>Moderate — manageable for most businesses</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.5–3.0</td><td>Elevated — watch interest coverage</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 3.0</td><td>High risk — one bad year could cause distress</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> Under 1.0. Under 0.5 is ideal.
<strong>Sector caveat:</strong> Banks and utilities structurally carry high D/E and
that's normal — use sector-adjusted comparisons for those.
<hr>
<h2>DCF METRIC</h2>
<h3>10. Margin of Safety (DCF)</h3>
<strong>What it is:</strong> The gap between a stock's estimated intrinsic value
(from our Discounted Cash Flow model) and its current market price.
The larger the gap, the more cushion you have if your assumptions are wrong.
<strong>Formula:</strong> <code>(Intrinsic Value - Current Price) ÷ Intrinsic Value</code>
<table><tbody>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>What it signals</th></tr>
<tr><td>Negative</td><td>Overvalued — trading above DCF estimate</td></tr>
<tr><td>0–20%</td><td>Fairly valued or small discount</td></tr>
<tr><td>20–40%</td><td>Attractive — meaningful discount to intrinsic value</td></tr>
<tr><td>40–60%</td><td>Very attractive — significant undervaluation</td></tr>
<tr><td>> 60%</td><td>Deep value or the DCF assumptions may be too optimistic</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<strong>Favorable for a 5-year horizon:</strong> 25%+ margin of safety.
<strong>Important caveat:</strong> A DCF is only as good as its inputs. The model uses
historical FCF growth rates capped at 25%, a 10% discount rate, and 3%
terminal growth. Treat it as a directional signal, not a precise target.
